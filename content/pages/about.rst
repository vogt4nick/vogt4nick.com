About
#####

I'm a data scientist at Dynatrace in Detroit, MI. I work on R&D to learn more about our customers and to drive tools to improve their experience with our product.

Before Dynatrace, I was a data scientist at Ford Motor Company. I spent the bulk of my time building tools to identify unnecessary costs and to find improvements in the supply chain. I also worked on container optimization.

I like helping young data scientists. Feel free to contact me if you think I can help. Let me know if you're near Detroit - we can meet over coffee.
